ProjectGM ToDo List:
====================



Still Needs Done:

	-Tile-to-Entity Collision Detection with all other entities
	-Grid Layout with Tile Objects
	-Toggleable gridlines, and Entity Box Lines with Debug Stats
	-Level Editor (Long Term)
	-Collision Detection bug with sliding against walls. Finding a way of ignoring box corners when checking for detection would work well...corner radius of 3-5px perhaps? It needs to at least be more than the pixel leap made by moving objects...


	





Finished:

	-Change Collision detection so instead of moving the player away from the colliding block, it sets the players x coordinate away from the block, ex:

		if (block.side()=="top") {
			Player.y = (block.y - Player.getHeight());
		}
