ProjectGM ToDo List:
====================

-Tile-to-Entity Collision Detection with all other entities
-Grid Layout with Tile Objects
-Toggleable gridlines, and Entity Box Lines with Debug Stats
-Level Editor (Long Term)


-Change Collision detection so instead of moving the player away from the colliding block, it sets the players x coordinate away from the block, ex:

	if (block.side()=="top") {
		Player.y = (block.y - Player.getHeight());
	}
